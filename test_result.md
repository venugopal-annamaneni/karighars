## Testing Protocol

### Communication with Testing Agents
1. **ALWAYS READ THIS FILE** before invoking any testing agent
2. **UPDATE the Test Cases section** with specific test scenarios
3. **MAIN AGENT**: Provide clear, specific test instructions including:
   - API endpoints to test
   - Expected behaviors
   - Test data to use
   - Authentication requirements
4. **TESTING AGENT**: Update results in the Test Results section
5. **MAIN AGENT**: Review results and address action items

### Testing Workflow
- Backend testing MUST be done first using `deep_testing_backend_nextjs`
- Frontend testing ONLY after user explicitly confirms
- NEVER invoke `deep_testing_frontend_nextjs` without user permission

## Original User Problem Statement

**Current Task**: Implement Dynamic Payment Milestone Categories in BizModel

**Key Requirements**:
1. Replace hardcoded category percentage columns (`woodwork_percentage`, `misc_percentage`, `shopping_percentage`) with dynamic JSONB structure in `biz_model_milestones` table
2. Update BizModel API to handle `category_percentages` JSONB instead of flat fields
3. Refactor BizModel UI to dynamically display all categories from `category_rates` in milestone configuration
4. Allow users to configure percentage for each category per milestone
5. Support N categories (not just 3 hardcoded ones)

**Recent Changes**:
- Updated schema.sql to replace flat percentage columns with `category_percentages` JSONB column
- Created and executed migration script (007_dynamic_milestone_categories.sql)
- Updated `/app/api/biz-models/route.js` POST handler to accept and insert `category_percentages` JSONB
- Modified `/app/settings/bizmodels/page.js` to:
  - Update milestone state to use `category_percentages: {}` instead of flat fields
  - Add `updateMilestoneCategoryPercentage()` helper function
  - Dynamically render percentage inputs for all categories based on `categories` state
  - Sort categories by `sort_order` in milestone configuration

## Test Cases for Backend Agent

### Test Scenario 1: Create BizModel with Dynamic Category Milestones
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/biz-models`
**Description**: Test creating a new BizModel with dynamic category-based milestones
**Test Data**:

    ]
  },

      }
    },
    {
      "milestone_code": "DESIGN_30",
      "milestone_name": "Design Approval",
      "direction": "inflow",

      "category_percentages": {
        "woodwork": 40,
        "misc": 40,
        "shopping": 100
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Result**:
- BizModel created successfully
- `category_rates` stored as JSONB with all 3 categories
- Milestones created with `category_percentages` JSONB structure
- Each milestone has dynamic category mapping (not hardcoded columns)

### Test Scenario 2: Verify Database Schema
**Description**: Verify that `biz_model_milestones` table has the correct structure
**Test Query**:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'biz_model_milestones' 
AND column_name IN ('category_percentages', 'woodwork_percentage', 'misc_percentage', 'shopping_percentage');
```

**Expected Result**:
- `category_percentages` column exists with type `jsonb`
- Old columns (`woodwork_percentage`, `misc_percentage`, `shopping_percentage`) should NOT exist

### Test Scenario 3: Fetch BizModel with Milestones
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/biz-models`
**Description**: Fetch BizModels and verify milestone structure
**Authentication**: Any authenticated user

**Expected Result**:
- Returns array of BizModels
- Each milestone has `category_percentages` JSONB field
- No flat category percentage fields in response

### Test Scenario 4: Create BizModel with 4 Categories
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/biz-models`
**Description**: Test with more than 3 categories (e.g., add "Civil" category)
**Test Data**: Similar to Scenario 1 but with 4 categories and corresponding milestone percentages

**Expected Result**:
- BizModel created successfully with 4 categories
- Milestones support all 4 categories in `category_percentages`
- System is truly dynamic (not limited to 3 categories)
