## Testing Protocol

### Communication with Testing Agents
1. **ALWAYS READ THIS FILE** before invoking any testing agent
2. **UPDATE the Test Cases section** with specific test scenarios
3. **MAIN AGENT**: Provide clear, specific test instructions including:
   - API endpoints to test
   - Expected behaviors
   - Test data to use
   - Authentication requirements
4. **TESTING AGENT**: Update results in the Test Results section
5. **MAIN AGENT**: Review results and address action items

### Testing Workflow
- Backend testing MUST be done first using `deep_testing_backend_nextjs`
- Frontend testing ONLY after user explicitly confirms
- NEVER invoke `deep_testing_frontend_nextjs` without user permission

## Original User Problem Statement

**Current Task**: Complete Invoice Management Feature implementation and fix closing tags issue in invoices page.

**Key Requirements**:
1. Fix closing tags syntax error in `/app/projects/[id]/invoices/page.js`
2. Finalize `OverInvoicedAlert` component integration
3. Ensure credit note creation works correctly
4. Validate invoice upload with amount restrictions
5. Test complete invoice management workflow

**Recent Changes**:
- Fixed JavaScript syntax error in invoices page (closing parentheses in map function)
- Updated invoice API validation to allow negative amounts for credit notes
- Verified OverInvoicedAlert component structure
- Verified integration in project layout

## Test Cases for Backend Agent

### Test Scenario 1: Invoice Upload
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/projects/{id}/invoices`
**Description**: Test uploading a new invoice for a project
**Test Data**:
- Use an existing project with positive balance
- Invoice amount should be less than available amount (payments_received - invoiced_amount)
- Include invoice document URL

**Expected Result**:
- Invoice created with status 'pending'
- Document inserted into documents table
- Activity log created

### Test Scenario 2: Credit Note Creation
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/projects/{id}/invoices`
**Description**: Test creating a credit note with negative amount
**Test Data**:
- Use same project from Test 1
- Invoice amount should be negative (e.g., -10000)
- Include credit note number (e.g., CN-123)

**Expected Result**:
- Credit note created successfully
- Negative amount accepted (validation should allow it)
- Status is 'pending'

### Test Scenario 3: Invoice Approval
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/projects/{id}/invoices/{invoiceId}/approve`
**Description**: Test approving a pending invoice
**Authentication**: Admin role required

**Expected Result**:
- Invoice status changes to 'approved'
- Project's invoiced_amount increases by invoice_amount
- Document entry created in documents table
- Activity log created

### Test Scenario 4: Credit Note Approval
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/projects/{id}/invoices/{invoiceId}/approve`
**Description**: Test approving a credit note (negative invoice)

**Expected Result**:
- Credit note status changes to 'approved'
- Project's invoiced_amount DECREASES (negative amount added)
- Document type should be 'credit_note'
- Activity log created

### Test Scenario 5: Fetch Invoices
**Endpoint**: `GET /api/projects/{id}/invoices`
**Description**: Fetch all invoices for a project

**Expected Result**:
- Returns array of invoices including credit notes
- Includes user names for uploaded_by, approved_by, cancelled_by
- Sorted by created_at DESC

### Test Scenario 6: Over-Invoicing Detection
**Description**: Verify that when invoiced_amount > final_value, the system detects it
**Test Steps**:
1. Create a project with an estimation (final_value = 100000)
2. Upload and approve invoices totaling 120000
3. Check if over-invoicing is detected in project data

**Expected Result**:
- Project's invoiced_amount should be 120000
- Frontend should show OverInvoicedAlert when accessing project
- Credit note should be suggested
