The AI engineer successfully initiated and developed a comprehensive Finance Workflow Automation Tool (ERP) for an interior design company, KG Interiors. The development followed a phased approach, starting with core functionalities, then advancing to complex financial workflows, reporting, and intelligent business model integration. Key milestones included PostgreSQL database setup, robust Google OAuth authentication, and a modular Next.js application with Shadcn UI. The engineer efficiently iterated on user feedback, implementing features like a flexible BizModel system, a detailed Project Ledger, Sales Order IDs, and dynamic estimation fields (service charge/discount). Recent work focused on enhancing data visibility and user configurability, tackling UI visibility issues, and addressing a critical batch of financial and document management features. The trajectory concludes with the engineer actively implementing customer KYC and GST features, demonstrating a systematic approach to feature integration.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a new set of requirements from the user (Chat Message 197). This involves enhancing the financial and document management aspects of the ERP system.

The work commenced with updating the PostgreSQL database schema. A new SQL script, , was created and applied to the database. This script introduced several crucial fields:
-    (TEXT),  (TEXT), and  (JSONB) to the  table to support detailed KYC information.
-    (NUMERIC) and  (BOOLEAN) to the  table to handle GST calculations.
-    (TEXT),  (NUMERIC), and  (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE) to the  table to track project-level invoices and revenue.

The database schema update was successfully completed (Chat Message 199). The immediate next step (Chat Message 200) is to update the frontend's customer creation form to incorporate the newly added KYC and bank details fields, allowing users to input this information. This is where the work currently stands, midway through implementing the document and financial features related to customer KYC and GST.
