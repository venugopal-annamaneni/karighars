The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the KG Interiors finance application, moving from initial bug fixes and invoice management to significant feature additions. Initially, the AI engineer resolved a syntax error in the  and finalized the Invoice Management feature, including the  and credit note functionality, which was declared fully functional after backend testing.

Following this, the AI engineer implemented a major Rooms/Sections feature for estimation items. This involved substantial database schema changes to  (adding , , , ), updating backend APIs () to handle these new fields and conditionally calculate , and a complete overhaul of the frontend UI. For the frontend,  (read-only display) was migrated to TanStack Table with row grouping and CSV export, while  (editable form) was also transitioned to an editable TanStack Table, but explicitly *without* grouping, incorporating inline editing, add/delete/duplicate row functionality, auto-calculations, validation, and keyboard navigation. This migration saw a brief, incorrect attempt to use AG-Grid, which was swiftly corrected and replaced with TanStack Table as AG-Grid Community Edition does not support row grouping.

The latest major feature implemented is Project Base Rates, enabling project-specific rate overrides with an approval workflow. This involved creating a new  database table, adding  to the  table, modifying the project creation API () to automatically copy BizModel rates into an initial  entry, and creating new API endpoints for managing these rates (viewing, requesting changes, approving, rejecting). The  was updated to fetch rates from the active  entry. A new UI page () was created for managing these rates, and a Base Rates tab was added to the project layout. The user's last action was a , after the AI engineer completed the Project Base Rates UI.

<product_requirements>
KG Interiors requires a finance management platform to replace Excel, providing real-time cash flow, commissions, and project financial health. The platform supports various workflows (Sales, Design, Shopping, Civil Vendor) and includes a Finance Dashboard, Project Ledger, Reports, and role-based access.

**Key implemented features include:**
*   Google OAuth for user authentication.
*   Customizable BizModel system with payment milestones and project stages.
*   Flexible payment overrides, Sales Order ID generation, Service Charge/Discount in estimations.
*   Project Ledger, Dashboard with charts, User/BizModel management UIs.
*   Customer KYC & GST with GST calculation at estimator level.
*   Document Management for payment receipts and project invoices.
*   Payment workflow refinement, milestone-based payments with  milestone.
*   BizModel versioning,  removal.
*   Overpayment handling, generating  entries, admin approval.
*   Advanced item-level calculations: item-level discounts, D&C charges on woodwork, Service charges on misc/shopping, with discounts. Shopping items track only KG's service charge.
*   Invoice Management: upload/view/approve/cancel invoices, track , generate credit notes for over-invoiced scenarios.
*   Estimation Item Rooms/Sections: Group estimation items by room and category. Quantity can be derived from Width x Height for 'sqft' units, or manually entered for 'no'/'lumpsum'. Room names are mandatory free text. Categories ordered Woodwork → Misc → Shopping.
*   Project Base Rates: Project-specific override for BizModel rates (service, design, shopping, GST percentages) with an approval workflow. An initial active rate is copied from BizModel on project creation. Estimators can request changes, which admins can approve/reject. Estimations use the currently active project base rates.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed the implementation of the Project Base Rates feature. This involved:
1.  **Database Updates**: Creating the  table and adding the  column to the  table, managed via SQL migrations.
2.  **Project Creation API ()**: Modified to automatically create an initial  and   entry by copying values from the selected BizModel when a new project is created, all within a database transaction.
3.  **New Base Rates APIs**: Created dedicated API endpoints for fetching all base rates (), fetching the active base rate (), submitting new rate change requests (), and for admin approval/rejection (, ).
4.  **Estimation Logic Update ()**: Modified to fetch the relevant rate model from the *active*  entry instead of directly from the .
5.  **New UI Page ()**: A new frontend page was created to display and manage the project's base rates.
6.  **Navigation Integration ()**: A new Base Rates tab was added to the project-specific navigation.

The AI engineer generated a summary document () stating the full implementation of the Base Rates feature (both backend and UI) was complete, and is now ready for manual testing by the user. The last action in the trajectory was a user request for a , which was completed successfully.
